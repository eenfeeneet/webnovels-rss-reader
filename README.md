# WebNoSSer

A web novel rss reader. Webnovels are novels/stories that are published on the web. There are many ways to publish a web novel and also a variety of websites that gives authors the platform to post their stories. For e.g Royal Road, Webnovels and Wattpad. Some choose to post their stories on their personal sites. Typically web novels are uploaded in chapters, that can range from 500 to 7000 words long. And chapter uploads depend on the author themselves. Some upload a chapter daily, some every 2 days while some do it monthly. Webnosser is a place where user can sign up for an account and add a novels ress feed to the list. That way novel readers can check on updates on their favorite novels all in one place.
